# CopperCode
CopperCode is a template for the free version of [CopperCube 6](https://store.steampowered.com/app/857350/) that:
* Focuses on a **code-first** approach to development using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
	* Changes easily tracked using version control software like Git and Perforce.
	* Easily searchable and JS/TS autocomplete within VS Code.
	* Allows for more complexity in systems.
* Uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile .ts and .js files into a minimized file readable by CopperCube.
* Uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management, which allows this template to come built-in with:
	* [Crash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crash-colliders) 2D collision library.
	* [TypeFlex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeflex) UI layout library.
	* Various shims and polyfills to allow ES2020 spec javascript to work in CopperCube.
